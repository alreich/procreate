Occasionally a tutorial will mention a brush, but not say which brush set it can be found in. To avoid having to look through every set to find it, I created an alphabetical list of brush names and set(s) where they can be found.  There are very likely errors here, so if you find any, let me know and I’ll update the list.

LEGEND: “Brush Name” - “Brush Set”
        *** - Indicates a copy of a default brush that came with Procreate
                 (i.e. not made by me; or possibly, made by me by accident :-)
