Occasionally a tutorial will mention a brush, but not say which brush set it can be found in. To avoid having to look through every set to find it, I created an alphabetical list of brush names and set(s) where they can be found.  There are very likely errors here, so if you find any, let me know and I’ll update the list. 

NOTE: There are several reasons for custom brushes that appear in my list.  Some might have been mistakenly created by me.  I've marked them with (???).  Others are "discontinued" brushes that still show up in my sets.  According to [Ref A], below, brushes were discontinue when Procreate transitioned from version 3.2.4 to 4,0, and when Procreate transitioned to version 5.0.  They are marked with (3>4) and (5), respectively, in my list.

[Ref A] - https://folio.procreate.art/discussions/10/28/43317

CUSTOM BRUSHES:
 (3>4) - Custom. Removed in Procreate 3.2.4 > 4.0 transition,
           according to [Ref A]. Appears now in my sets as a custom brush
   (5) - Custom. Removed in Procreate 5.0 release, according to [Ref A];
           Appears now in my sets as a custom brush
 (???) - Custom &/or Default. Sometimes the same brush appears as both
           a default & a custom brush in either the same or different lists.
           Not sure why.  Some might be due to my mistakes.
Pocket - All of the Pocket brushes show up as custom brushes.
           Some are duplicates of default brushes; others are unique.
